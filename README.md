# HONMA Protocol

HONMA (HTTP Oriented Native Media Architecture) is a minimalist application protocol for Web communication interfaces built on top of HTTP. Born in the peaceful Honmachi district of Osaka, it embodies the Japanese philosophy of minimalism and efficiency.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity**: Like Japanese zen gardens, HONMA keeps only the essential elements
- **Built on Standards**: Leverages existing HTTP mechanisms and REST architectural style
- **Constraint-Driven Design**: A minimal set of rules that promote API consistency
- **Native Web Integration**: Works harmoniously with HTTP conventions and semantics

## Documentation

The specification is currently available in French:

- [Philosophy](docs/fr/Philosophy.fr.md) - Explores HONMA's design principles and philosophy
- [Specification](docs/fr/Specification.fr.md) - Technical specification of the protocol
- [Examples](docs/fr/Example.fr.md) - Concrete examples showing HONMA in action

_(English documentation coming soon)_
